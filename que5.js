let sum = 5 + 5 + "5";

console.log(sum);

//The output of the above code is 105 this is because the first two values are integer type and the third one is a string and therefore because of the + operator the addition of the first two integers is concatenated with the value of the string which is 5 and therefore sum of of the two integers gives 10 and when concatenated with the string value "5" makes it 105
